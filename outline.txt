STOCK TRADING SOFTWARE
<!--
    Trading is not easy. You have to have a solid background (Order types, indicators, account activity -- and other related things) in order to trade effectively.

    Trading is complex, and it's even more complex building a software for it.

    I dont' have solid trading background. I'm learning while building this software.

    This should be interesting, fun and frustrating at the same time!
