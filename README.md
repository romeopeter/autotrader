# Autotrader

A Python bot for mimicking trading financial instrument on behalf of human using the [TDAmeritrade API](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis).

I lost the motivation to continue building and customizing due to not being able to sign up for a TDAmeritrade account from my region.

I might come back to it later (Assuming my documentation helps) with an alternative API platform though, but for now? Nah!

I learnt how to use Pandas and Numpy...so I consider that a win.
