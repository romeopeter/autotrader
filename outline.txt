STOCK TRADING SOFTWARE
<!--
    Trading is not easy. You have to have a solid background (forex, stocks, quotes, indicators, signals account activity -- and other related things) in order to trade effectively.

    Trading is complex, and it's even more complex building a software for it.

    I dont' have trading background. I'm learning while building this software.

    This should be fun, interesting and frustrating at the same time!
